Description: FPOPapproximation is an R package written in Rcpp/C++ and developed to detect changes using the Functional Pruning Optimal Partitioning method (FPOP) in p-variate time series of length n. The FPOP method consists in analysing some subsets Zit, i = 1,.., t at each iteration t, each of them being associated to a last change-point candidate in the dynamic programming algorithm. The subsets Zit are described by the intersection of elementary (convex) sets Sij and Sjt and their complement. In Gaussian case the sets S are p-balls. Our package explores a few pruning strategies to detect the emptiness of the Zit set. This task is difficult in dimension greater that 1 and we need to develop approximation strategies. Our goal is to find approximations leading to a reduced time complexity from quadratic to quasi-linear as obtained by the FPOP algorithm in dimension 1 on simulations.
